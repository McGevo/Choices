<h2>How this Questionnaire Works</h2>
    <p>This Questionnaire comprises of 3 Parts :</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Personality Test</li>
      <li>A Course Enrolment Quiz</li>
      <li>A Report generator</li>
    </ol>

<p>The Personality Test is used to understand your interests and career potential in a particular field and then point you towards your most suited course to enroll in. It will ask you to check off activities which interest you and you believe are improtant in everyday life. From here, a score will help determine what field of study could be right for you.</p>

<p>Enrolling in a subject from a broad field can be overwhelming for many students. How do you know you've made the best choice for your future? This is where the Course Enrolment Quiz comes in. The Course Enrolment Quiz is used to filter through all your study options from any TAFE department and suggest one specific course for you to study, along with a handful of suitable alternatives.</p>

<p>At the end of this questionnaire, a report will be presented to you documenting the questionnaire's findings. You can download this report or retake the questionnaire to see how the choices you make can change your course recommendation. You will be presented with the option to contact a course lecturer in the area of study you've been recommended.</p>
